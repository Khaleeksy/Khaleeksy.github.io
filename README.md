## Dap me Up
This is dedicated to my Spring Introduction to Digital Arts and Humaities 2023 course at NYUAD. Welcome to death row. 

#### Formal Intorduction???
This website will be used as a platofrm for me, Khaleeqa, aka a trini living in the middle east, to share myself with you. I know for a fact you'd find me as fascinating as a find myself so is this introduction really needed?(My apologies, back to formalities...)For my Spring 2023 Semester at NYUAD, my Introduction to Digital Arts and Humanites course requires the creation of a website, whereby we would be able to use this platform not only to woo those viewing, with the very interesting assignments we woud be posting here over the course of the semester, but to express ourselves on a platform created by us, for us!
