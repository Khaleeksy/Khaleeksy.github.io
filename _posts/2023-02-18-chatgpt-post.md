# Digital Literacy Narative

When I hear the words <mark>digital literacy<mark>, I immediately think of my ability to operate my cell phone. After giving my initial ideas a lot of thought, I'm sure digital literacy encompasses a little bit more. With this idea, I don't believe my grandmother would be regarded as a very digitally literate person :joy: , so perhaps this needs some revision. After using my go-to search engine, Google, I learned that digital literacy actually refers to a specific set of skills that enable you to participate fully and function in the digital world. Being digitally literate is something I think is expected of me as a 19-year-old. Being at ease with technology and using it effectively and efficiently is second nature to me; however, unlike my younger siblings, I did not grow up with my face glued to an iPad, so this second nature was something I developed as my life progressed. Therefore, even though I consider myself to be digitally literate, I think true digital literacy involves using technology correctly and responsibly, as opposed to just knowing how to use it.

Like any other 19-year-old, I use social media sites like Instagram, Twitter, Tik Tok, and WhatsApp in my daily life. My main reason is to reconnect not only with friends and family, but also with my home country, as I no longer live there. Since I can only communicate with my twin islands through a digital platform, I have had to develop the skills necessary to function and take part in the activities I long to be a part of from a distance. For instance, to account for the time difference, I typically post content in the early morning hours. Being 8 hours apart makes it extremely challenging to manage daily obligations and have a conversation with friends and family via these platforms, so it is typically necessary to plan ahead. However, a handy one-am post lets my friends and family know I'm still alive and well, and I typically wake up to lovely morning messages that I wouldn't have received at home. It's a win-win situation.

Along with my personal experiences, I also heavily rely on digital literacy for my academic work. My academic digital literacy goes beyond just knowing how to use Microsoft Office to ensure that my essays are perfectly typed, my schedule is meticulously organized in a spreadsheet, and my PowerPoint presentations are top-notch. I believe this is the point at which digital literacy should be used properly. Not only must you submit everything online, but you must also do so honestly and with integrity. When using all digital platforms, you should use the same self-responsibility and self-awareness that you would in public settings. 

As a computer science major skilled in C++ and C programming, I particularly understand the **frustrations** associated with digital platforms. However, it is important to note that these sophisticated data analysis and manipulation programs enable us to manipulate data in ways that are not possible in a physical environment. My eyes have been opened to the wide range of technology and tools available for managing and analysing research data as a result of this digital arts and humanities course. Although basking in the journey without solutionism is most definitely outside of my purview, the change is comforting because it enables the exploration of new media and technologies.
